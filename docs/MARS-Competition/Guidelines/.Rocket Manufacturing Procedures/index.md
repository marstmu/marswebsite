MARS meeting 27.04.2024


- Rockets Work-sessions Plan

- Test Rocket is ready. 
- Needs to be hot fired with working avionics. 
    Where can we test the rocket?
    Assembly procedure is ready. Another rocket needs to be manufactured in the next 2 days to take photos of each step. 
    Write the procedure in mars website. 
    The plan is to release on Monday 2d sketches of avionics bay, nose cone and fins, so that teams could CAD those, print and prepare DXF files for laser cutting. On tuesday and Wednesday people should be laser cutting and by the end of Wednesday, teams must all have parts ready. 
    Materials need to be purchased: acrylic, plywood, epoxy, ca glue, etc.
    Thursday, friday, saturday if necessary rockets manufacturing. 
    After rockets are done, teams will have a week to colour their rockets and pick the themes (Saturn 5, falcon 9, starship, etc). 
    And launch those. 

    Avionics: - what is left to be tested? After rockets are manufactured, what is the plan with avionics? Anymore work-sessions?
    Hiring new people: have a meeting on monday with Nordeep to discuss with her help with merch, and active mars marketing (post a lot of photos from avionics worksession, pratt sponsorship, announce launch day on 18th of May, etc). 
    Budget update is needed. How much money we currently have. 
    LC logistics. We need to start thinking ahead of LC, preliminary ideas, what and how. Ll talk to Steven about LC right after MARS competition. 
    What winners of the competition are getting? Needs to be finalized!
