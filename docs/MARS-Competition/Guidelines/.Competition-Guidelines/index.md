# Competition Guidelines

## Outline
The competition will be happening at [CRC] on **May 18th**. Each team will SSH into their raspberry pi and establish communication with their flight computer. A live stream of data should be recorded in real time. One by one, teams will launch and recover their rockets. After the flight, SD cards from the flight computer will be given to the judges for verification. We don't want to have post flight presentations. Instead, each team will have 30 minutes to submit a final pull request to the website. This will include graphs and gifs of their flight. Teams will have to prepare methods of interpreting and posting their data and gifs.

### Avionics
- Soldering
- Code

### Structures
Teams will be marks on the construction and design of their rockets. This marking will be done before flight in a "safety review."

### Launch Day
Teams will be marked on their professionalism and performance of their avionics and rockets, as well as ability to adapt to problems. 

### Post Launch
#### Documentation
Each team will be marked on their documentation which should be contributed to their teams section on the [github]. Teams are encouraged to contribute to the git repo at any time. There will be tutorials on how to make pull requests.

#### PFR
There will be no PFR (post flight review), just documentation on the website.
