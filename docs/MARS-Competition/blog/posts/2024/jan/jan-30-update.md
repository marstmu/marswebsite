There will now be a message posted to discord whenever the blog is updated! This will be the first post that does this. 

The fuselages, and motor tubes, and a few other things have arrived! We have already given out fuselages to a ICARUS and Lunar Wolves. We will be in contact shortly with each team to give out the fuses.

Here's a photo of me picking up the packages. Photo cred to Nikolai.
