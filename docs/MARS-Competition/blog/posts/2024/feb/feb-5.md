Rocketry room 10AM Tuesdays! (and online on discord) Bao suggested we start having weekly general meetings, and I think this is a great idea. We will try to make the meetings as efficient as possible by having an agenda that we go through, and time afterwards for random discussions. We will first go through team updates, then we will assign tasks. The [tasks list is on the drive], and [on the website].
