Last Wednesday we had our Rockets 101 tutorial, which had a great turnout of over 100 people!

The presentation taught the basics of rocketry, including history, engines, and all of the physics that our teams will need to keep in mind while constructing their rocket.

Big thanks to our guest speaker Zeul, who taught us about solid rocket motors.

Hope to see everyone at our first OpenRocket tutorial happening today at 6pm!!
