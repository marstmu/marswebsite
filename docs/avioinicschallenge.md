# Challenges

The Mars 2024-2025 Winter Break Avionics Challenge is live!

**WIN $50, and some MARS merch for Designing a PCB**

---

## Who is this for?

This challenge is for anyone with some or no experience in PCB design who wants to learn more. 1st and 2nd year students are prioritized. No commitments and no other requirements are needed.

Please sign up using [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvOUBgUmTJmOR8HCJTWi-2iwKz4vOlpNkXhPdT7K4GSJgenw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## What you have to do

- Design something fun (doesn't have to be avionics related) in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) or [Altium](https://www.altium.com/) and order it from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).
- Document as much as you see fit.
- Order your PCB on January 13th, submit your documentation and PCB in person to KHN03 on January 30th.
- [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.ca/) is recommended for components

We can provide feedback on your design, but there won’t be any tutorials for this challenge.  

Keep in mind, it takes about two weeks for a PCB to arrive from JLCPCB.

MARS does not pay or reimburse you for your PCB.

## Why is MARS Hosting This?

We need help with our avionics projects! This event is a way to discover talented individuals who are skilled in PCB design. We will be doing many many more of these challenges. The next one will begin sometime in February

We may also use this opportunity to recruit for the Mars Avionics Team.  
Good luck, and happy designing!
