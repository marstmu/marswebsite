# Competition Guidelines

## Outline
The competition will be happening at Cambridge Rocket Club ([CRC]) on **May 18th, 2024**.  
- Each team will remote through Secure Shell (SSH) into their Raspberry Pi and establish communication with their flight computer.  
- A live stream of data should be recorded in real-time.  
- One by one, teams will launch and recover their rockets.   
- After the flight, SD cards from the flight computer will be given to the judges for verification.  

We don't want to have post flight presentations. Instead, each team will have 30 minutes to submit a final pull request to the website. This will include graphs and videos/images of their flight. Teams will have to prepare methods of interpreting and posting their data and visuals in advance.

### Avionics
- Soldering
- Code

### Structures
Teams will be marks on the construction and design of their rockets. This marking will be done before their flight in a "safety review."

### Launch Day
Teams will be marked on their professionalism and performance of their avionics and rockets, as well as ability to adapt to problems that come up before their launch. 

### Post Launch
#### Documentation
Each team will be marked on their documentation which should be contributed to their teams section on the [GitHub]. Teams are encouraged to contribute to the repository at any time. There will be tutorials on how to make pull requests to the website.

#### Post Flight Review (PFR)
There will be no PFR, just documentation on the website.
