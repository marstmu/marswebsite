# Join

Joining the liquid rocket team generally consists of doing a challenge, documenting everything in markdown, submitting your results, then formally joining. In order to keep everything we do open and extremely well documented, everyone joining should be well versed in Git and GitHub usage, as well as whatever specialty they bring. Coders, and MCAD, and ECAD designers must go through the [Git branching tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).

All work done for challenges shall be documented using markdown, and posted on the website.
