# Competition Team

The MARS Competition is a student design team at Toronto Metropolitan University with the goal of educating students about model rocketry.

MARS opens the doors to designing, manufacturing, and launching rockets. We host tutorials to teach students all they need to know to create their own rockets!

The MARS Competition runs once every semester.

During the summer months, MARS invites the top teams to attend Launch Canada, the countryâ€™s first and only annual rocket competition, to attain their Tripoli High Power Rocketry (HPR) certifications.
