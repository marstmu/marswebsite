# Certifications

The certification team on MARS is responsible for the design, manufacturing and launch of level 1, 2 and 3 certification rockets under Tripoli Rocketry Association. 
Currently, we are certifying some of our members at rocketry clubs such as Launch Canada, URRG and the Quebec Rocketry Club, but our long term goal is to be able to certify from within MARS.
