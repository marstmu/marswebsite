# Winter 2024-2025 Avionics Challenge

The Mars 2024-2025 Winter Break Avionics Challenge is live!

**WIN $50, and some MARS merch for Designing a PCB**

---

## Who is this for?

This challenge is for anyone with some or no experience in PCB design who wants to learn more. 1st and 2nd year students are prioritized. No commitments and no other requirements are needed. 

The point of this challenge is to learn as much as possible, so even if your PCB doesn't work properly, you may still have a chance of winning if your documentation is good.

Sign ups are currently closed. The next challenge may happen in February.

## What you have to do

- Design something fun (doesn't have to be avionics related) in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) or [Altium](https://www.altium.com/) and order it from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).
- Document as much as you see fit.
- Order your PCB on January 13th, submit your documentation and PCB in person to KHN03 on January 30th.
- [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.ca/) is recommended for components

We can provide feedback on your design, but there wonâ€™t be any tutorials for this challenge.  

Keep in mind, it takes about two weeks for a PCB to arrive from JLCPCB.

MARS does not pay or reimburse you for your PCB.

## Requirements

### Documentation

There are no requirements for formatting, length for documentation, however the ideal documentation includes the following:

- Design process, component selection
- What went right, and wrong
- What you learnt
- Uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for writing

### Originality

No requirements, but the ideal board is fully custom. You can use an off the shelf board but it must make up less than 10%ish of all components on your board.

## Teams

You may work in a team, however solo is recommended, and the prize will be split between team members.

## PCB Ideas

- Blinking led with 555 timer
- Variable brightness LED
- An acceleration logger using an MPU6050
- An air quality monitor using a BME680
- Servo controller

## Why is MARS Hosting This?

We need help with our avionics projects! This event is a way to discover talented individuals who are skilled in PCB design. We will be doing many many more of these challenges. The next one will begin sometime in February

We may also use this opportunity to recruit for the Mars Avionics Team.  
Good luck, and happy designing!
