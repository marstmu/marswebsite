# Composite Layup

The Mojave Sphinx does not necessitate composite layup, but it would be good to know how to do for the future, as well as for potentially making our own body tubes for the competition team.

You're expected to document everything throughout the entire process. This includes all processes, material choices, everything you learnt, what went right, what went wrong and more. The higher the quality the better.

## Challenge

Build a prototype fuselage for a 4" model rocket. The tube should be similar in size to [this one](https://www.allrockets.ca/Build/Airframes/Phenolic/40). It definitely can't have a smaller inner diameter than 3.9 inches, but the outer diameter and length is more flexible. The material choice is up to you.
