# Test Stand

We are going to want to do many static tests of the rocket. Design a test stand for it in Solidworks. Reference the [CAD](https://github.com/marstmu/4in-liquid-rocket).

Submit a link to your GitHub repo containing the files to your proposed test stand. If the design is approved by the team MARS will pay for the materials, and you will assemble it.
