# O-Ring Sizing

Use the [Parker O-Ring Handbook](o-ring-sizing/ORD-5700.pdf) to size o-rings. Reference the [CAD](https://github.com/marstmu/4in-liquid-rocket).

The Mojave Sphinx doesn't really use robust calculations for the O-rings. [Here is the link](https://www.halfcatrocketry.com/o-ring-design) to how they do it. [This](https://www.mcmaster.com/9056K42/) is the tank used, it may have to be changed.
