# Calculations

This page will cover how to size the thrust chamber for the Mojave Sphinx.

<!-- ## Terms:

- $L^\ast$ : Characteristic length.
- $c^\ast$ : Characteristic velocity. -->

## Oxidizer:Fuel Ratio 

Let's first determine what we want out O:F (Oxidizer:Fuel) ratio to be. This will allow us to set tank volume accordingly. We will calculate the stoichiometric ratio, then decide is we want to adjust it to something more oxidizer or fuel rich depending on our structural capabilities for our thrust chamber. 

The following is a balanced reaction of pure $N_2O$ and Ethanol

$$
6 N_2O + C_2H_5OH \rightarrow 6 N_2 + 2 CO_2 + 3 H_2O
$$

As can be seen by the balanced equation, the molar ratio is 6:1. 

To get mass ratio, use molecular weights: 

- $N_2O$: 44 g/mol
- $C_2H_5OH$: 46 g/mol. 

Mass ratio = $(6 \times 44) : (1 \times 46) = 264 : 46 \approx 5.74:1$.


## Goal

What are we looking for? 

We want the exit mach number to be as high as possible. This is will be achieved by matching the exit pressure as close to the atmospheric pressure as possible.

## Misc

There's a careful play between orifice sizing and initial fuel amount. You want to have about a 5:1 ox:fuel ratio by mass roughly.
