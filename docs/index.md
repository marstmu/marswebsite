**MARS**, [TMU's] Model Rocket Society, is organized into two main divisions: Research and Competition.

---

In the Competition division, 10 teams compete to launch their best rocket. Workshops are held to teach the teams Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Open Rocket Simulation, GitHub, KiCad PCB Design, the Linux Operating System, soldering and electronics fundamentals, Arduino Runtime, and ANSYS simulation and 3D design software. Teams go through design reviews and are scored based on their documentation. Teams are taught how to make a "default rocket." The Competition division is geared specifically towards beginners/first-year students, but experienced rocketeers are welcome to join a team and make their own rocket too.

The Research division focuses on improving the rockets built in the Competition division and other Student Research and Designed (SRAD) technology. This is achieved by developing new things such as Thrust Vector Control (TVC), custom PCBs, building the launch pad, and programming firmware. The Research division works somewhat on a per-project basis. All project documentation is made open source, including CAD files/code, and tutorials run by MARS are built off of it.

There is additionally a division for Logistics. This team oversees the Competition and Research divisions and the team budget, organizes events, and creates long-term plans for the team.

Members of MARS can be in any or all of the available divisions.
