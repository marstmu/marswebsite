# Status Page
We will keep this page up to date with the current status of where there teams should be at, and where the logistics are at. **Check the bottom of this page to see when it was last updated.**

## Teams Status

By now, your team should have a decent CAD design of your rocket.  
You should have used the BOM from the [Rocket Guide].  
Half of the teams have submitted their Preliminary Design Report (PDR), which is meant to showcase your current progress.  
This is not a requirement, but you lose 15% on the final judging if you opt out of it. 

As always, feel free to reach out in your team-specific Discord channel if you are feeling confused about anything!

## Our Status
We are now giving out fuselages, motor mounts, and parachutes.  
Each team will be contacted to set up a time to pick up their supplies!
