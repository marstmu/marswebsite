The leads team has been busy with all of the background work to prep for the Winter 2025 session (check out Ivan working hard taking inventory).


With that being said, the first event of the semester is coming up soon, our **Winter 2025 Kickoff Meeting**📢📢

Come by to learn about what we do, how the competition will be structured, and meet other interested students!
