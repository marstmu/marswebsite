# 0.0.2

This is the prototype power module. I made this for learning's sake. It took 15 days to arrive from JLCPCB with assembly using "Global Standard Direct Line" shipping. It cost $116.28 CAD for 5 boards. All the functions work perfectly including the battery level monitor! I noticed the charging/switching IC did get a little warm. I also put a 3.3k resistor where I was supposed to put a 330 ohm resistor. This didn't cause any problems.
