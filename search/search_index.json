The reason for this is to have the amplifier be compatible with any common 12V power supply, while also having the supply voltage for the transistor low enough so that the bias current is kept to a manageable amount.</p> <p>The design is a standard class A setup with the voltage divider created by R3 and R4 setting the operating point of the transistor to ~4.1V with no signal applied. This sets the bias current to around 300mA. R1 sets the output impedance of the amplifier, and the ratio between R1 and R2 approximately sets the voltage gain.</p> <p>The general process for choosing these values was:</p> <ul> <li>VCC: chosen based on the desired max output voltage</li> <li>R1: chosen based on the desired output impedance, while also keeping the bias low enough so that large heatsinks are not required</li> <li>Voltage drop across emitter resistor R2: Anywhere in the range of 1-2V, with higher voltage resulting in a more stable bias network</li> </ul> <p>The rest of the values are then calculated from these chosen values, the gain of the transistor, and the desired voltage divider current ratio (current flowing through R3 of the voltage divider vs the current flowing into the base, usually in the range of 10-16, where higher values result in a more stable voltage divider output).</p> <p>The value of 4700uF for the input and output capacitors was chosen to set the -3dB cutoff frequency to be less than 2Hz.
